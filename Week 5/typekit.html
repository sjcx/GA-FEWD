						Each piece contains multitudes: snippets of memoir, paragraphs of exegesis, fragments of history, melancholy, joy. It's a good book for readers who like to think as they read, and an excellent corrective for those of us who may have fallen out of the habit.

						There's a pleasant
						familiarity to the plot of Emma Straub's debut novel, "Laura Lamont's Life in Pictures,"
						whose protagonist's life traverses the arc of a Hollywood biopic: early tragedy, rise to

						something new: The superstar is nice.
